This project demonstrates how to implement user authentication in a Next.js application using Supabase.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Enable users to sign up, log in, and reset their passwords securely.

- **Supabase Integration**: Explore the versatility and simplicity of Supabase's authentication functionalities.

## Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A React framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.
- [Supabase](https://supabase.io/): An open-source alternative to Firebase offering authentication, real-time database, and more.
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/): The programming language used for the project.
